export const binaryTreeStory = `So remember Tree Corp? The company where the CEO is at the top, managers have teams, and the structure flows downward.
One day, the CEO makes a new rule:

“From now on, every manager can have at most 2 team members under them. Not more.”
This is called the Two-Member Policy.

The CEO (Root) can have up to 2 managers directly reporting.
Each manager can also have up to 2 employees under them.
And this continues downward.
So the whole company now looks like a clean family tree where every person can only handle 2 direct reports — one on the left side, one on the right side.

The cool part?

The left and right team members aren’t just random — their positions matter when we start giving them “special rules” (that’s when we’ll meet Binary Search Trees later).
But for now, just know: Binary Tree = A Tree where each node can have max 2 children.
So in short:

Normal Tree Corp: Any manager can hire unlimited team members.
Binary Tree Corp: Strict rule -> only 2 team members allowed per manager (left & right).`;
