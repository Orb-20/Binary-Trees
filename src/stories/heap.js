In Tree Corp, the CEO wasn’t fully satisfied.

Yes, the company had the Two-Teammate Policy (Binary Tree) and even the Sorted Teammates Policy (BST)…

…but things were still a bit messy.
So the CEO announced a brand-new golden rule:

The Strongest-on-Top Policy
Here’s how it works:

In this system, the boss (parent) must always be stronger or more powerful than their teammates (children).
This means:
In a Max-Heap, the boss always has the highest value compared to their teammates. (CEO flexes the hardest).
In a Min-Heap, the boss always has the lowest value compared to their teammates. (CEO is the most humble).
So at every level of Tree Corp:

The boss is always either the strongest (Max-Heap) or the weakest (Min-Heap).
But — unlike BST — we don’t care about left vs right order. Only one thing matters: the boss must dominate their squad.

Why Tree Corp loves this rule:

⚡ Quick access -> Need the strongest (or weakest) teammate? Just look at the top (the root).
🔄 Efficiency -> Promotions/demotions (insert/delete) happen fast while keeping the “Strongest-on-Top” vibe.
🎯 Perfect for tasks like priority jobs, leaderboards, or scheduling.
👉 In short:

Binary Tree Corp = Max 2 teammates.
BST Corp = Teammates sorted (left smaller, right bigger).
Heap Corp = Parent always stronger (Max-Heap) or weaker (Min-Heap) than teammates.`;
