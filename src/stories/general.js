export const generalTreeStory = `Imagine a big company called Tree Corp.

At the very top, there’s one CEO.

👉 This CEO is the Root of the company.
The CEO hires a few managers.

👉 These are the Nodes.
Each manager can hire their own team members (more nodes).

👉 Every employee has only one boss (one parent), but a boss can have many employees (children).
Some employees don’t hire anyone under them — they’re just chilling.

👉 These are the Leaves of the company.
And here’s the rule in Tree Corp:

No employee can ever be their own boss (no loops).
The structure always flows downward from CEO -> Managers -> Teams.
Why is Tree Corp successful?

🗂️ Organized hierarchy -> You instantly know who reports to whom.
🔍 Easy searching -> To find any employee, just follow the chain from the CEO.
🚀 Flexible growth -> New hires can easily be added under the right manager.
👉 So in DSA, a Tree is just like Tree Corp’s hierarchy:

Root = CEO
Nodes = Managers/Employees
Leaves = Chill employees with no team.`;
