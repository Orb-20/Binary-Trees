export const binarySearchTreeStory = `Tree Corp: The “Sorted Teammates Policy” (BST)
In Tree Corp, the CEO already made the Two-Teammate Policy (Binary Tree rule: max 2 teammates under each person).
But now the CEO wants things to be more organized. So a new rule drops:

The Sorted Teammates Policy
Here’s how it works:

If a teammate joins with a lower rank/value than the boss -> they go to the left side.
If a teammate joins with a higher rank/value than the boss -> they go to the right side.
And this rule isn’t just for the CEO.

Every manager and teammate in Tree Corp follows the same rule for their own left and right teammates.
So the whole company becomes like a sorted org chart:

Left side always has “smaller” teammates.
Right side always has “bigger” teammates.

Why Tree Corp loves this rule:

🏃 Faster searching -> Want to find someone? Don’t check everyone. Just keep going left for smaller or right for bigger until you find them.
🗂️ Organized growth -> As new teammates join, they automatically know where they belong.
🔎 Clear hierarchy -> No confusion, no mess, all sorted.
👉 So in short:

Binary Tree Corp = Max 2 teammates under any manager.
BST Corp = Same, but sorted by rank/value: left is smaller, right is bigger.`;
